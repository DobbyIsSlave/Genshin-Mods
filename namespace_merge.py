# Special Thanks:
#   SilentNightSound#7430 much of this guy's code was used for this
#   bloodreign616#4766 (pirilika) did much of the testing on this script
# V2.2 of Mod Merger/Toggle Creator Script utilizing namespaces

# Merges multiple mods into one, utilizing name spaces

# USAGE: Run this script in a folder which contains all the mods you want to merge
# So if you want to merge mods CharA, CharB, and CharC put all 3 folders in the same folder as this script and run it

# This script will automatically search through all subfolders to find mod ini files.
# It will not use .ini if that ini path/name contains "disabled"

# NOTE: This script will only function on mods generated using the 3dmigoto GIMI plugin
